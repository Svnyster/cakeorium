Smelting cake makes cakeorium ingots

Cakeorium ingots can be crafted into tools and weapons

Using a cakeorium tool/weapon (right-click or shift+right-click) will eat the item, refilling the player's hunger and decreasing the item's durability

Multiple tiers of cakeorium ingots (first tier is from smelting a vanilla cake in a furnace)
Higher tiers make stronger cakes, which increase durability and effectiveness

Negative effect of eating item is chipping your tooth, which will deal damage, but still restores your hunger
Chacnce of chipped tooth increases with cakeorium tiers

Highest tier would cause slowness after eating
